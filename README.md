# Portfolio

The program is given a 2D array of float values defining a grid of points. The value stored at each location on the grid corresponds to the cost of going through the corresponding point.

The program builds the graph connecting the nodes. For each path on the graph connecting the two endpoint nodes, it createa a child process that will determine the path on the grid going through the nodes of the path.

You can use the Build Script to first compile, then the run script to execute the program. Checkout the parameters in the Scripts folder.
