This program stores characters in a certain order. It imitates some functions of the C++ string.

 * Notes: this implementation uses a dynamic array. So, potential
 * drawbacks as compared to the CharLinkedList class include slower insertions
 * and removals at the front of the list. On the other hand, since only one
 * pointer variable is needed for the entire list (as opposed to one pointer
 * per element in the CharLinkedList), the CharArrayList class has the
 * advantage of more efficient memory usage over the CharLinkedList.
